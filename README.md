# Healthcare Insights Dashboard
**Project Overview** </br>  
</br>  
This Power BI dashboard project was commissioned by Acme Healthcare Solutions to provide comprehensive data-driven insights into their healthcare operations. The primary objectives of this project were:</br>  
</br>  
**Patient Information Tracking**:</br>  > Analyze key patient details, including admission, discharge, and follow-up dates, to better understand patient journeys.</br>  
**Billing and Insurance Coverage:** </br>  >Uncover insights into the total billing amounts, health insurance coverage, and the financial implications of different diagnosis types.</br>  
**Bed Occupancy Trends**: </br>  Visualize bed occupancy patterns, categorized by bed type (Private, General, ICU), to identify peak utilization periods and optimize resource allocation</br>  
**Doctor Performance Evaluation**:</br>   Assess overall doctor feedback scores to recognize top-performing physicians and identify areas for improvement.</b>
**Diagnosis-wise Statistics**: </br>  Investigate the distribution and prevalence of various diagnosis types, such as Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia, and Fracture.</br>
